**Machine Learning project on Pre-Owned Car Price Prediction using Python**:

**1. Introduction**
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to predict the price of pre-owned cars based on various features.
Use Case: Helps buyers and sellers estimate a fair market value.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Flask (for deployment).

**2. Data Collection & Preprocessing**
Data Source: Online car listings, Kaggle datasets, web scraping, or dealership databases.
Features to Consider:
Car Brand & Model
Manufacturing Year
Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/Electric)
Transmission Type (Manual/Automatic)
Engine Power & Mileage
Number of Previous Owners
Location & Market Demand
Data Cleaning:
Handling Missing Values
Removing Duplicates
Standardizing Formats (e.g., converting categorical data to numerical)

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
Visualization: Use Seaborn & Matplotlib for insights.
Correlation Analysis: Identify important features.
Outlier Detection: Handle extreme values using boxplots, IQR, or Z-score.

**4. Feature Engineering**
Encoding Categorical Variables: One-Hot Encoding / Label Encoding.
Feature Scaling: Normalize numerical features using MinMaxScaler or StandardScaler.
Feature Selection: Use techniques like Mutual Information, PCA, or Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE).

**5. Model Selection & Training**
Algorithms to Consider:
Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
XGBoost
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Splitting Data: Train-Test Split (80-20 or 70-30)
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV

**6. Model Evaluation**
Metrics Used:
RÂ² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
